# calculator
I have created this repository by the languages like html,css,python and the main languages used is python here.
By HTML,we can create all the button over the calcculator.
By CSS,we can create all the colors and outlines in the calculator.
By python,as it is backend we can use to do validation and also create gui in the interface of the output.
